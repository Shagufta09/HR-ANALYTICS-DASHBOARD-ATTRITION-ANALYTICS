# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD-ATTRITION-ANALYTICS
Employee attrition isn’t just an HR challenge — it’s a data problem.

- I built an HR Analytics Dashboard to understand and analyze employee attrition across multiple dimensions, including job roles, departments, age groups, education levels, salary slabs, and years of experience.

- The dashboard focuses on key KPIs such as overall attrition rate, average employee age, and average years spent in the company, along with interactive visuals that help identify trends, high-attrition segments, and early-tenure exits.

- This project helped me strengthen my understanding of people analytics, KPI design, and how HR data can be transformed into actionable insights to support better workforce and retention decisions.
